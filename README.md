# MULTIMODAL-DIALOGUE-SYSTEM-SEAMLESS-SIGN-LANGUAGE-TO-TEXT-AND-SPEECH-TRANSLATION

Abstract : 
Sign language is vital for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community. However, a significant communication gap remains due to a lack of widespread knowledge of sign language and limited availability of interpreters. This project proposes a real-time multimodal dialogue system that uses neural networks to enable seamless translation between Indian Sign Language (ISL), text, and speech.

Our system employs CNN and RNN models for gesture recognition and achieves an accuracy of 98.0% for 26 alphabetic gestures. It also supports real-time text-to-sign and speech-to-text translation using advanced natural language processing techniques.

Final Outcome Of Our Project :
