# MULTIMODAL-DIALOGUE-SYSTEM-SEAMLESS-SIGN-LANGUAGE-TO-TEXT-AND-SPEECH-TRANSLATION

Abstract : 
Increasing communication accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities has drawn a lot of attention in recent years, especially when integrating multiple dialogue systems. This report presents a comprehensive dialogue system developed across several conversational programs to enable smooth translation between sign language to speech and   text. The system uses a bidirectional approach to translate spoken language into text and sign language and to convert sign language into speech and text. With the ultimate goal of developing inclusive communication tools, this dialogue system tackles issues like contextual understanding, logical speech interpretation, and real-time processing. With an emphasis on its possible effects on accessibility and social inclusion, user studies and performance simulations are used to determine the efficiency of our methodology. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through user studies and performance simulations that focus on potential impacts on social inclusion and accessibility. The findings show that the proposed dialogue system not only enhances communication but also creates greater understanding between different language groups.

Objective :
•	To create an effective system for recognizing sign language and to increase recognition accuracy and support various signing styles, including a variety of sign language dialects.
•	To develop a real-time algorithm that reliably converts sign language movements into text.
•	To utilize cutting-edge Natural Language Processing methods and models for Creation of NLP module that can handle text produced by spoken input and sign language.
•	To create a system for precise speech synthesis and recognition that efficiently converts spoken words into text for additional processing. 
•	To create a user-friendly interface that makes simple transition between spoken and sign language modes.
